# 用户管理故障诊断{#troubleshoot-user-management}

有关在 Adobe Target 中管理用户的故障诊断信息。

## I invited a user to Target, but his or her name does not display in the Users list (Administraion > Users). {#section_13A1A9697BA44537BA569C81CF136160}

You will not see the new user listed on the [!UICONTROL Users] page until the user logs in using his or her Adobe Experience Cloud account and then logs in to [!DNL Target Standard/Premium].
